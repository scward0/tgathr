### US-013: Automatic Event Cleanup (3 Story Points)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed & Deployed
**Goal:** Implement automatic cleanup of expired events with 24-hour notifications

#### Implementation Details

**Database Schema Update:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added `notificationSentAt DateTime?` field to Event model

**Core Service Layer:**
- `src/lib/services/cleanup-service.ts` (NEW) - 227 lines
  - `previewCleanup()` - Preview events to be deleted without executing
  - `sendExpirationNotifications()` - Send 24-hour warning emails
  - `deleteExpiredEvents()` - Delete expired, non-finalized events
  - `runCleanup()` - Main orchestration function

**Email Notifications:**
- `src/lib/email.ts` - Added `sendEventExpirationNotification()`
  - Warning email sent 24 hours before deletion
  - Includes response status (X/Y participants responded)
  - Clear call-to-action to finalize event
  - Uses existing mock/production pattern

**API Endpoints:**
- `src/app/api/events/cleanup/route.ts` (NEW)
  - POST endpoint to trigger full cleanup process
  - Requires authentication
  - Returns summary of notifications sent and events deleted

- `src/app/api/events/cleanup/preview/route.ts` (NEW)
  - GET endpoint to preview cleanup without executing
  - Requires authentication
  - Shows count and list of events that would be deleted

**Comprehensive Testing:**
- `src/lib/services/__tests__/cleanup-service.test.ts` (NEW) - 17 test cases
  - Preview functionality tests
  - Notification sending with success/failure scenarios
  - Event deletion with error handling
  - Full cleanup orchestration tests
  - Edge cases and error conditions
  - **Coverage: 100% on cleanup service**

- `src/app/api/events/cleanup/__tests__/route.test.ts` (NEW)
- `src/app/api/events/cleanup/preview/__tests__/route.test.ts` (NEW)
  - Documented testing approach (API routes tested via service layer)

**Safety Features:**
1. üîí Never deletes finalized events (enforced in all queries)
2. ‚è∞ 24-hour notification window before deletion
3. üìß Tracks notifications via `notificationSentAt` (prevents duplicates)
4. üîê Authentication required on all endpoints
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Comprehensive error handling (continues even if individual operations fail)
6. üìù Detailed logging for audit trail

**Test Results:**
```
Test Suites: 13 passed
Tests: 201 passed, 1 skipped
Cleanup Service Coverage: 100%
TypeScript: ‚úÖ Passing
Linting: ‚úÖ Passing
```

**Production Deployment Notes:**
- Database migration completed in Neon (added `notificationSentAt` column)
- Ready for automated scheduling via cron job
- Recommended: Run daily at 2 AM

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/services/cleanup-service.ts`
- `src/lib/services/__tests__/cleanup-service.test.ts`
- `src/app/api/events/cleanup/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/events/cleanup/preview/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/events/cleanup/__tests__/route.test.ts`
- `src/app/api/events/cleanup/preview/__tests__/route.test.ts`

**Files Modified:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `src/lib/email.ts`

## üêõ Bug Fix: Availability Form Time Slot Selection

**Issue:** When users selected "Morning" time slot, the "All Day" option was incorrectly auto-selected as well.

**Root Cause:** The `isSlotSelected()` function only checked `startTime` to determine selection state. Since both "Morning" (09:00-12:00) and "All Day" (09:00-22:00) start at 09:00, they were treated as the same slot.

**Solution:** Updated selection logic to check both `startTime` AND `endTime` for unique identification.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/AvailabilityForm.tsx`
  - Fixed `isSlotSelected()` function (lines 103-121)
  - Fixed `toggleTimeSlot()` function (lines 62-103)

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/__tests__/AvailabilityForm.test.tsx` (6 comprehensive tests)

**Tests Added:**
1. ‚úÖ Render time slot options correctly
2. ‚úÖ Selecting morning does NOT select all day
3. ‚úÖ Selecting all day does NOT select morning
4. ‚úÖ Can select both independently
5. ‚úÖ Toggle functionality works correctly
6. ‚úÖ Selected times count displays accurately

**Test Results:**
```
Test Suites: 14 passed
Tests: 207 passed, 1 skipped
```

**Before:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå Only checked startTime
slot.startTime === startTime
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Checks both for unique match
slot.startTime === startTime && slot.endTime === endTime
```

## üö® Production Issue Resolved

### Database Schema Mismatch (Vercel + Neon)

**Issue:** After deploying US-013 to production, all events disappeared and users couldn't create new events.

**Root Cause:**
- Code deployed with updated Prisma schema (`notificationSentAt` field)
- Database migration (`npx prisma db push`) was not run
- Neon database missing the new column
- All Event queries failing due to schema mismatch

**Resolution:**
1. Accessed Neon SQL Editor
2. Ran: `ALTER TABLE "Event" ADD COLUMN "notificationSentAt" TIMESTAMP;`
3. Events immediately reappeared

**Time to Resolution:** ~5 minutes

**Lesson Learned:** Always run database migrations in production before deploying code with schema changes.

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Document migration steps in deployment checklist
- Consider adding automated migration to deployment pipeline
- Run migrations in this order: Database ‚Üí Code deployment

## üí° Key Learnings

### What Went Well
1. ‚úÖ **Systematic Approach:** Breaking down US-013 into service layer, API, and tests made implementation smooth
2. ‚úÖ **Test-First Mindset:** Comprehensive tests caught issues early
3. ‚úÖ **Clean Architecture:** Separation of concerns (service layer vs API routes) made code maintainable
4. ‚úÖ **Quick Recovery:** Database migration issue resolved in ~5 minutes due to clear error messages
5. ‚úÖ **Documentation:** Clear comments and helper files aided debugging

### What Could Be Improved
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deployment Process:** Should have run database migration BEFORE pushing to main
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Migration Checklist:** Need automated reminder or deployment script for schema changes
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Testing Strategy:** Could add E2E tests for cleanup flow
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitoring:** Need better alerting for production schema mismatches

### Action Items for Next Sprint
