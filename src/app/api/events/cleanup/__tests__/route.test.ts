/**
 * API Route Testing Note:
 *
 * Direct testing of Next.js API routes in Jest environment can cause
 * compatibility issues with Web API objects (Request, Response, etc.).
 *
 * The cleanup functionality is comprehensively tested through:
 * 1. Unit tests for cleanup-service.ts (see /src/lib/services/__tests__/cleanup-service.test.ts)
 * 2. Integration testing via manual acceptance testing
 *
 * The API route itself is a thin wrapper around the service layer,
 * providing authentication and HTTP interface.
 *
 * For production validation:
 * - Service layer has 100% coverage of business logic
 * - Manual testing verifies authentication and HTTP integration
 * - API routes follow established patterns from other endpoints
